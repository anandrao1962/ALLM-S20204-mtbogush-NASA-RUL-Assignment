# NASA-RUL-Assignment

## Project Overview
This project is part of the predictive maintenance assignment focused on estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using machine learning models, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural networks. The project uses NASA’s C-MAPSS dataset, which contains run-to-failure data for engines under various conditions.

The objective is to predict the RUL of engines to improve maintenance schedules and avoid unexpected failures.
